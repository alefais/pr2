Projects of the Programming 2 course of the Computer Science Bachelor's Degree @ University of Pisa.

- Project 1:
  
  the definition of an interpreter for a functional language (with the distinction between the concrete and the abstract         syntax). The language has been implemented using Ocaml in two versions: the first one follows the static scoping rule and     the other one adopts the dynamic scoping rule.


- Project 2:
  
  the implementation in Java of a data structure useful for the management of a blogging platform. The interface is given by     the professor in order to guide the implementation.
